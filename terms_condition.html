        <p style="font-style: italic;">Pincode Requirements
        </p>
        <p>It is the user 's responsibility to provide correct pincode in the address of delivery. The pin code should
            map to the correct delivery address. Sometimes the address mentioned does not correspond to the pin code of
            that area.
        </p>
        <p>If pin code entered in the address section is incorrect then following cases arise -
        </p>
        <p>1. Address entered is of Non-Serviceable area, the order stands cancelled and NO refund will be initiated -
            The system checks pincode for delivery verification and may accept order when pin code entered is of
            serviceable area and address is not.
        </p>
        <p>2. If our team contacts you regarding the wrong pin in address, and you want to get delivery done to the new
            pin code, the charges of the newly added pin code will apply. The order can not be cancelled and refunded in
            case you do not wish to pay for correct pin code’s charges.
